                            <h2>Synaptive Medical Emerges from Restructuring with New Ownership and Investment</h2>
<p><strong>Toronto, ON – July 2, 2025</strong> – Synaptive Medical, a global innovator in medical technology, has successfully completed a strategic restructuring, culminating in its acquisition by a consortium of MedTech executives, clinicians, and experienced investors. The deal, which follows a period of financial difficulty and creditor protection, marks a new chapter for the company, securing its future and reaffirming its commitment to advancing neurosurgical care.</p>
<p>The new ownership and a significant private investment will enable Synaptive to move towards profitability and continue its focus on developing and expanding its integrated suite of surgical technologies. This includes their Modus X™ robotic exoscope, Modus Nav™ surgical navigation system, and Modus Plan™ planning platform, alongside their dedicated MRI technology.</p>
<p>The company had previously faced financial headwinds, citing high research and development costs, intellectual property maintenance, and the impact of market uncertainties, including potential U.S. tariffs, as contributing factors to its financial challenges. Earlier this year, Synaptive had obtained protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA).</p>
<p>Throughout the restructuring process, Synaptive has maintained customer support and continued its innovation pipeline, including recent software upgrades and new collaborations with medical centers in the United States and Europe. Company founder, Cameron Piron, expressed a continued commitment to investing in the tools and technologies that advance surgical planning, neuro-navigation, and robotic exoscopy. An incoming board member, Dr. Joshua Bernstock, a neurosurgeon, stated the new investment represents a powerful recommitment to Synaptive's mission to transform brain health.</p>

                            <h2>SOL Global Proposes Warrant Repricing Amid Debt Restructuring</h2>
<p><strong>Toronto, ON –</strong> SOL Global Investments Corp. has announced a significant proposal to reprice its outstanding common share purchase warrants in a move to better align with current market conditions. This development is part of a broader financial restructuring that also includes a substantial debt settlement.</p>
<p>On June 17, 2025, SOL Global announced its intention to reduce the exercise price of all its outstanding common share purchase warrants to C$0.12 per share. This repricing is subject to the consent of all warrant holders and compliance with the policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE). The warrants affected were originally issued between December 2024 and March 2025 with exercise prices ranging from C$0.30 to C$0.65. The expiry dates of the warrants will remain unchanged; however, an acceleration clause will be introduced. This clause would shorten the expiry date if the company's common share closing price on the CSE exceeds the new exercise price by more than 25% for 10 consecutive trading days.</p>
<p>This proposed warrant repricing is taking place alongside a significant debt settlement. The company initially announced plans to settle approximately $6.63 million in debt by issuing 66.3 million common shares at a price of $0.10 per share. A subsequent announcement on July 17, 2025, confirmed the completion of a debt settlement for approximately $6.14 million through the issuance of 61.4 million common shares at the same price. On July 22, 2025, the company disclosed a further debt settlement of about $155,819 by issuing 1.56 million common shares.</p>
<p>In a corporate update on July 17, 2025, SOL Global confirmed it is continuing to seek the necessary consents from warrant holders for the proposed repricing. The company also recently resolved a dispute with Sire OC W2 Trading over a purchase agreement for Solana tokens.</p>
<p>These strategic financial moves, including the warrant repricing and debt settlements, are aimed at improving the company's financial standing. SOL Global has also recently undergone board changes and appointed a new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as it sharpens its focus on crypto innovation and investments within the Solana blockchain ecosystem. The company's shares are now also listed on the OTC Markets under the symbol SOLCF to enhance visibility and accessibility for U.S. investors.</p>

                            <p>No relevant articles were found for a company specifically named "Cooltech Corp." within the past 30 days. However, research has identified a recent development for a similarly named entity, <strong>CoolTech LLC</strong>, and provides context on other companies with "Cooltech" in their names for which no recent news was found.</p>
<h3><strong>CoolTech LLC</strong></h3>
<p>A recent article in Medscape, published on July 21, 2025, discusses the use of the CoolStat Transnasal Thermal Regulating Device, developed by CoolTech LLC, for migraine relief. The article reviews two clinical trials that have tested transnasal evaporative cooling as an acute treatment for migraines, showing some level of efficacy and safety.</p>
<p>The first study, CALM 1, had enrollment issues and was terminated early. However, in a small group of patients, the lowest flow rate of the device was found to be the most effective, with eight out of nine patients reporting pain relief at two hours, and four of them being pain-free.</p>
<p>A second study, CALM 2, utilized a smaller, portable device for at-home use. The 10 LPM air flow rate was the most effective, showing a statistically significant number of patients achieving pain freedom at two hours compared to a sham treatment.</p>
<p>A third, larger phase 3 trial, CALM 3, is currently underway to further test the device at a 10 LPM dose against a sham. The results of this trial are anticipated in September 2025. The findings from these studies are described as "very promising" for the potential of this device in treating migraines.</p>
<h3><strong>Other "Cooltech" Companies</strong></h3>
<p>It is important to note that there are other companies with similar names for which no news within the last 30 days was found:</p>

                            <h3>Osisko Development Corp. Warrants in the News: A Look at Recent Developments</h3>
<p><strong>For fiscal year 2025, there have been significant announcements regarding Osisko Development Corp.'s warrants in the past 30 days.</strong> The company has been active in securing financing for its key mining project, which has directly involved the issuance of new warrants.</p>
<p><strong>Financing Secured for Cariboo Gold Project with Warrant Issuance</strong></p>
<p>On July 21, 2025, Osisko Development Corp. announced a major financing deal to advance its Cariboo Gold Project in British Columbia, Canada. The company entered into a credit agreement for a senior secured project loan facility of US$450 million.</p>
<p>As part of this credit facility, Osisko will grant 5,625,031 non-transferrable common share purchase warrants to the lender, Appian Capital Advisory Limited. These warrants will have an exercise price of CAD$4.43 per common share and will be valid until July 21, 2028. This move provides the lender with potential equity upside in the project's success. Osisko Development retains the option to repurchase these warrants at their Black-Scholes valuation, a mechanism to manage potential dilution of its shares.</p>
<p>The initial draw from this credit facility is US$100 million, which will be used to accelerate pre-construction activities at the Cariboo project. The subsequent US$350 million will be available upon a final investment decision and meeting certain project milestones. The credit facility has a maturity date of July 21, 2033.</p>
<p>This financing and the associated warrant issuance are crucial steps for Osisko Development as it advances its key asset towards production. The structure of the deal, including the warrant component, is a common feature in mining finance, aligning the interests of both the borrower and the lender.</p>

                            <p>Toronto, ON – July 24, 2025 – Nuvau Minerals Corp. (TSXV: NMC) has been the subject of recent news, with significant developments in its exploration activities and corporate leadership. The following is a summary of news articles about the company from the past 30 days.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration Program Uncovers Visible Gold</strong></p>
<p>On July 22, 2025, Nuvau Minerals announced the launch of a gold-focused exploration program at its Matagami Property in Quebec. The first drill hole of this program intersected visible gold, suggesting the presence of an orogenic lode gold system. This discovery is considered significant as it is located near the past-producing Bracemac McLeod Mine and shifts the focus from the property's historical association with base metals. The company is highly encouraged by these initial findings and is planning follow-up drilling. Assays for the initial drill hole are currently pending.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate Update: New Chair of the Board Appointed</strong></p>
<p>Nuvau Minerals announced the results of its annual and special meeting of shareholders on June 30, 2025. A key outcome of the meeting was the appointment of Steven Bowles as the new Chair of the Board.</p>

                            <h3>Ocean Harvest Technology Faces Financial Turmoil and Seeks Urgent Funding</h3>
<p><strong>July 2025</strong></p>
<p>Ocean Harvest Technology Group plc is facing a critical period marked by urgent funding needs and significant financial challenges. The company, a developer of seaweed-based animal feed additives, has been the subject of several key announcements and developments over the past 30 days.</p>
<p><strong>Key Developments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Removal from FTSE Russell Index:</strong> Following a suspension of over 40 business days without a clear indication of resumption, Ocean Harvest Technology Group was set to be removed from the FTSE Russell Index on July 21, 2025. This action underscores the prolonged uncertainty surrounding the company's stock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Urgent Need for Funding:</strong> The company has been actively seeking additional funding to continue its operations beyond mid-June 2025. Despite a 65% year-over-year increase in first-quarter revenues, the company remains unprofitable. Discussions with a number of investors regarding potential funding have been ongoing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial Crisis and Trading Suspension:</strong> In late May 2025, Ocean Harvest Technology announced the suspension of its shares on the AIM market. This was prompted by a default on its secured loan notes, leading to a demand for immediate redemption from noteholders. This has created significant uncertainty about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discussions with Loan Note Holders:</strong> The company confirmed it remains in discussions with its secured loan note holders to find a potential funding solution. While the noteholders have the right to demand immediate redemption and enforce their security rights, no such demand had been made as of early May.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Risk of Insolvency:</strong> Reports from mid-June indicated that Ocean Harvest Technology faces a risk of insolvency due to a potential default on its loan notes. This highlights the precarious financial position of the company.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, Ocean Harvest Technology is currently navigating a severe financial crisis. The company's ability to secure new funding is critical to its survival as it faces the potential for insolvency and the consequences of defaulting on its loan obligations. The suspension of its shares and removal from a key index reflect the market's concern over its future prospects.</p>

<p><strong>Vancouver, B.C.</strong> - NevGold Corp. (TSXV: NAU) (OTCQX: NAUFF) (Frankfurt: 5E50) has been the subject of significant news over the past 30 days, primarily centered around a successful, upsized private placement financing and promising drill results from its key exploration project.</p>
<p>The company announced in mid-May its intention to raise capital and, due to strong investor interest, subsequently increased the offering. On May 29, 2025, NevGold announced the closing of its upsized brokered private placement, raising gross proceeds of C$6 million. The financing consisted of 20 million units priced at C$0.30 each. Each unit includes one common share and one-half of one common share purchase warrant, with each whole warrant exercisable at C$0.45 for a period of 24 months.</p>
<p>The net proceeds from this financing are intended to advance the company's gold and copper projects, including the Limousine Butte and Nutmeg Mountain projects in Idaho and the Zeus Copper Project, also in Idaho.</p>
<p>In addition to the successful financing, NevGold also released encouraging exploration results. On June 25, 2025, the company reported some of its highest-grade oxide gold-antimony results to date from the Limousine Butte Project in Nevada. Earlier in the month, on June 12, 2025, NevGold announced that it had extended oxide gold-antimony mineralization over 1.7 kilometers at the Cadillac Valley target within the same project.</p>

The financing consisted of units priced at C$0.45, with each unit including one common share and one-half of a common share purchase warrant. Each whole warrant allows the holder to purchase a common share at C$0.55 within 24 months. The company intends to use the net proceeds to advance its Gold Chain project in Arizona and for general working capital.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration and Drilling Updates:</strong></p>
<p>West Point Gold also released a series of positive exploration results from its Gold Chain Project in Arizona. In mid-June, the company reported drill results that expanded a defined high-grade zone. This was followed by a July announcement of further drill results that continued to expand the mineralized zone at Northeast Tyro.</p>
<p>Most recently, on July 10, 2025, the company announced positive preliminary metallurgical results from the Gold Chain Project. The tests indicated gold recoveries of up to 86%, suggesting the gold is cyanide-soluble and potentially recoverable through conventional methods.</p>
<p>In other developments, West Point Gold announced it would not be proceeding with its option agreement for the Jefferson North Project in Nevada. The company also entered into a new marketing agreement.</p>

                            <h3>Cliffwater Corporate Lending Fund Sees Significant Growth, Surpasses $30 Billion in Assets</h3>
<p><strong>July 24, 2025</strong> - The Cliffwater Corporate Lending Fund (CCLFX) has experienced a period of significant growth and positive developments over the past 30 days, highlighted by the announcement that its net assets have surpassed $30 billion. This milestone underscores the fund's leading position in providing individual investors with access to private debt.</p>
<p>A key announcement on July 22, 2025, detailed the fund's achievement of reaching over $30 billion in net assets. This growth is attributed to the fund's innovative structure, which offers features such as no investor qualification, daily subscriptions, immediate capital deployment, and quarterly liquidity. Since its inception in 2019, the fund has generated an annualized return of 9.63% by investing in loans to middle-market companies. The fund's portfolio is diversified across more than 3,900 unique private credit borrowers, with a significant 96% allocated to first-lien senior secured loans as of June 30, 2025.</p>
<p>The growth of the Cliffwater Corporate Lending Fund has been a notable contributor to the record expansion of the non-listed closed-end fund market in the second quarter of 2025. A report from XA Investments LLC highlighted that the top 20 largest funds in this category, including Cliffwater's, accounted for half of the total net flows.</p>
<p>In addition to these milestones, Cliffwater has provided insights into the current private debt environment.

                            <h3>Curo Group Emerges from Bankruptcy, Now a Private Company</h3>
<p><strong>GREENVILLE, S.C.</strong> - Curo Group Holdings Corp. has successfully emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as of July 19, 2024. The company will now operate as Curo Group Holdings LLC. This marks a new phase for the financial services provider, which is now better positioned for long-term profitable growth.</p>
<p>The restructuring plan, which was confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas on May 16, 2024, has relieved Curo of approximately $1 billion in debt and is expected to reduce its annual interest obligations by at least $75 million. The plan received overwhelming support from the company's stakeholders.</p>
<p>As a result of the restructuring, Curo is now a private company, and its equity will no longer be listed on any public stock exchange. The company's CEO, Doug Clark, stated that emerging from Chapter 11 makes the business "substantially stronger." The plan ensures that all allowed claims from general unsecured creditors, including trade, customer, employee, and landlord claims, will be paid in full.</p>
<p>The company had voluntarily filed for a prepackaged Chapter 11 reorganization in March 2024 to implement a restructuring support agreement. Curo also received recognition of its reorganization plan from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Canada.</p>

                            <h3>Curo Financial Emerges from Bankruptcy, Sheds $1 Billion in Debt</h3>
<p><strong>Greenville, S.C.</strong> - Curo Group Holdings Corp., a consumer finance company, has successfully emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a new entity, Curo Group Holdings LLC. The company's reorganization plan, confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, has allowed it to eliminate approximately $1 billion in debt and reduce its annual interest obligations by at least $75 million.</p>
<p>As a result of the restructuring, Curo is now a privately held company, and its stock will no longer be traded on public exchanges. The company's leadership views this as a fresh start, with CEO Doug Clark stating, "Today's announcement marks the beginning of a new chapter for Curo." He added that the company is now a "substantially stronger business" and is better positioned for long-term profitable growth.</p>
<p>The plan had received overwhelming support from the company's stakeholders. Curo had filed for bankruptcy protection in March 2024 to implement a restructuring agreement supported by a majority of its lenders. At the time, the company faced a significant debt burden of over $2 billion.</p>
<p>The company will continue to offer a variety of financial services to its customers. In a move to unify its brand presence, Curo announced earlier this year that it would be consolidating its 390 U.S. branches under the single brand name, Heights Finance. This rebranding is part of a broader strategy to enhance its focus on providing best-in-class financial solutions.</p>

                            <h3>Southern Cross Gold Sees Significant Exploration Success and Upgrades to TSX Main Board in Past Month</h3>
<p><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong> - Southern Cross Gold Consolidated Ltd (ASX: SX2, TSX: SXGC) has been the subject of several significant news announcements over the past 30 days, primarily focused on promising exploration results from its Sunday Creek project in Victoria, Australia, and its recent graduation to the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) main board.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration Highlights at Sunday Creek</strong></p>
<p>On July 23, 2025, Southern Cross Gold announced a significant expansion of high-grade mineralization at its Christina prospect, a key area within the Sunday Creek project. The company reported that drilling has extended the gold-antimony mineralization to a depth of 600 meters and that the mineralized strike length now extends to 1.5 kilometers. The discovery of new vein sets and the presence of visible gold have been highlighted as indicators of potential for further growth, reinforcing the view of Sunday Creek as a major gold-antimony discovery. Following this news, the company's shares were down 5%.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate Developments</strong></p>
<p>A major corporate milestone was achieved on July 2, 2025, when Southern Cross Gold commenced trading on the TSX main board under the ticker symbol "SXGC". This move from the TSX Venture Exchange is anticipated to provide the company with greater access to capital markets, enhanced liquidity, and increased exposure to institutional investors. The company will also continue to trade on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) under its existing symbol "SX2". Shareholders were not required to take any action in relation to the listing change.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, on July 8, 2025, a "CEO.CA's Inside the Boardroom" segment featured Southern Cross Gold, discussing the significance of the new TSX listing and the positive drilling results from the Sunday Creek project.</p>

                            <h2>EnCore Energy Sees Production Surge and Cost Cuts Amidst Strategic Shifts</h2>
<p><strong>Corpus Christi, Texas</strong> - EnCore Energy Corp. (NASDAQ: EU, TSXV: EU) has reported a significant increase in uranium extraction rates and a reduction in production costs over the past month. The company, a key player in the U.S. uranium sector, also announced strategic asset sales and the receipt of a key operational license. However, the company's stock was recently removed from a major market index.</p>
<p>In a notable operational update, enCore Energy announced that its Alta Mesa In-Situ Recovery (ISR) Uranium Central Processing Plant achieved record uranium capture rates, exceeding 3,000 pounds per day with a peak of 3,705 pounds on June 20, 2025. The company has dramatically increased its daily uranium extraction from under 2,000 pounds to over 3,700 pounds per day. This surge in production is attributed to operational improvements and an expansion of drilling capacity. Alongside this production growth, the company successfully reduced its cash costs from approximately $40.80 per pound to $32 per pound in the latest quarter.</p>
<p>Further bolstering its operational capabilities, enCore Energy received a radioactive materials license for its Upper Spring Creek ISR Uranium Project in South Texas. This allows for the construction of wellfields and a satellite plant that will feed into the Rosita ISR Uranium Central Processing Plant. Construction on the new facility is set to begin within 30 days of the announcement made in late May.</p>
<p>On the financial front, enCore announced the sale of its entire stake in Anfield Energy Inc., generating approximately CAD $19.55 million. This move is part of a broader strategy to strengthen the company's balance sheet.</p>
<p>Despite the positive operational news, EnCore Energy Corp. was recently dropped from the Russell 3000 Growth Benchmark and the Russell Microcap Growth Index.</p>
<p>The company continues to focus on its in-situ recovery technology, a non-invasive uranium extraction process that utilizes natural groundwater and oxygen. EnCore is headquartered in Corpus Christi, Texas, and holds interests in various uranium projects across Texas, Wyoming, South Dakota, and New Mexico.</p>

                            <p>In the past 30 days, Stallion Uranium Corp. has announced several key developments primarily focused on its exploration activities and financial arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration Advancements at Coyote Project:</strong></p>
<p>Stallion Uranium has been actively advancing its Coyote Project within the Southwestern Athabasca Basin. On July 14, 2025, the company announced the completion of a 3D gravity inversion for the project. This was followed by a news release on July 21, 2025, detailing that a ground electromagnetic (EM) survey had refined the Coyote Target, identifying highly conductive anomalies. These steps are crucial in identifying potential uranium mineralization.</p>
<p><strong>Financial and Corporate Updates:</strong></p>

<p>It is important to note that while the query was for "Stallion Uranium Corp Warrants," the available news pertains to the parent company, Stallion Uranium Corp. There were no specific news articles found for the warrants themselves.</p>

                            <p>As of July 24, 2025, there has been limited specific news coverage regarding the Fiera Comox Global Agriculture Open-End Fund in the past 30 days. However, a recent development within the broader Fiera Comox entity provides some insight into their investment activities.</p>
<p>On July 15, 2024, it was reported that Canadian fund manager Fiera Comox has entered into a joint venture, acquiring an 85% interest in a 45,500-hectare forestry portfolio in New Zealand alongside Ngāi Tahu Holdings, which will retain the remaining 15%. This transaction marks the first acquisition for Fiera Comox's Global Sustainable Timberland Strategy. While this investment was made through their timberland fund, the report also noted that Fiera Comox's 2017-vintage open-end Global Agriculture Fund holds more than $1.4 billion in assets. This indicates the continued significant scale of the global agriculture fund within Fiera Comox's broader natural capital investment platform.</p>

                            <h3>CBRE Establishes Second U.S. Logistics Investment Program for Japanese Investors</h3>
<p><strong>Tokyo, Japan – June 10, 2025</strong> – CBRE has launched its second "US Industrial Venture (UIV)" program, aimed at providing Japanese investors with opportunities in the U.S. logistics facility development market. This new program, following the initial UIV1 which focused on a Chicago-based facility, will invest in a logistics project in Buford, Georgia, within the Atlanta metropolitan area.</p>
<p>Construction on the "Buford Creek Business Center" commenced in May 2025, with a projected completion date of September 2026. The Atlanta area is a significant logistics hub, being the largest in the southeastern United States and the fourth-largest market in the nation. The development site's proximity to major transportation routes, specifically Interstates 85 and 985, makes it a prime location for both urban and long-distance freight distribution.</p>
<p>The second UIV program has attracted investments from prominent Japanese companies, including Hankyu Hanshin Properties, Keihanshin Building, and Nippon Steel Kowa Real Estate. This initiative is a collaborative effort between CBRE's Investment Banking and Asset Management divisions and will be executed in partnership with Trammell Crow Company (TCC), a leading U.S. developer and part of the CBRE Group.</p>
<p>This program is designed to offer Japanese companies a streamlined entry into the growing U.S. logistics real estate market, which is benefiting from structural shifts such as supply chain restructuring and increasing demand. By partnering with CBRE and TCC, Japanese investors can access robust development projects and opportunities for stable income generation.</p>

                            <h3>Overbay Technology Leaders IV LP: Fund Value Jumps 18% on AI Investments</h3>
<p><strong>A private equity fund managed by Overbay, focused on artificial intelligence, saw its value increase by 18% during the recent quarter, according to a performance report from National Bank Financial.</strong> This significant upward revaluation was attributed to the fund's holdings in leading AI companies, including OpenAI and Anthropic.

<p>Overbay Technology Leaders IV LP is part of Overbay's broader strategy of investing in secondary private equity. This approach involves purchasing existing stakes in mature funds, which provides investors with immediate exposure to established companies and the potential for quicker returns compared to traditional private equity funds. Overbay's funds aim to offer global diversification across various sectors and a shorter investment horizon of 3 to 5 years.</p>

<p><strong>New York, NY – July 24, 2025</strong> – In the past 30 days, global software investor Insight Partners has been featured in the news for its leadership in generative AI, strategic investments, and portfolio company activities. Here's a summary of the key developments:</p>
<p><strong>Insight Partners Leads in Generative AI Consulting</strong></p>
<p>A recent analysis highlights Insight Partners' prominent role in the burgeoning generative AI consulting market, which is projected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2030. The firm is recognized for its ability to connect AI innovation with practical enterprise execution. Insight Partners leverages strategic alliances with major cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft, and Google Cloud, alongside investments in vertical SaaS companies in sectors such as healthcare and construction, to promote scalable AI adoption and cost efficiencies.

<p><strong>Strategic Investment in AI Compliance</strong></p>
<p>Insight Partners recently led a $32 million Series A funding round for Delve, an AI compliance automation startup. This investment has propelled Delve's valuation to $300 million.

<p><strong>McLean, VA – June 13, 2025</strong> – Cricket Media has announced significant changes to its well-known children's magazines. Starting in September/October, the company will integrate its STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) and nonfiction content into its flagship literary magazines.</p>
<p>Under the new structure, <em>LADYBUG</em> magazine will incorporate content from <em>CLICK</em>, blending storytelling with science and discovery for younger readers. <em>SPIDER</em> will integrate content from <em>ASK</em>, and <em>CRICKET</em> will feature content from <em>MUSE</em>, <em>FACES</em>, and <em>COBBLESTONE</em>, creating a richer mix of literature, science, history, and world cultures.</p>
<p>The company has assured subscribers that the core literary focus of the magazines will remain, and the integration will provide a broader range of content at no additional cost. The magazines will also be longer to accommodate the new material.</p>
<p>In addition to the content changes, Cricket Media has moved to a new bi-monthly publishing schedule for all nine of its magazines, which began in March 2025.</p>
<h3>Report Highlights Ongoing Payment Issues to Contributors</h3>

                            <p>As a professional financial analyst, here is a summary of the key news articles concerning Organigram Holdings Inc. for the past 30 days, from June 24, 2025, to July 24, 2025.</p>
<h3><strong>Recent Developments for Organigram Holdings Inc.</strong></h3>
<p>Within the last 30 days, Organigram Holdings Inc. has been the subject of significant company announcements, primarily focusing on its expansion into the United States market.</p>
<p><strong>U.S. Market Expansion</strong></p>
<p>A major development for Organigram has been the launch of its e-commerce platform for its recently acquired Collective Project, a hemp-derived THC beverage business. This strategic move marks the company's entry into the U.S. market, with direct-to-consumer sales now available in 25 states. This expansion is a key part of Organigram's strategy to accelerate top-line growth and establish a presence in the rapidly growing U.S. hemp-derived THC beverage market, which is projected to reach $4 billion by 2028. The initial product offerings include a diverse line of sparkling juices and lemonades, with plans to introduce a new line of bold hemp-derived THC sodas called Fetch later in the summer.</p>
<p><strong>CEO Succession Plan</strong></p>
<p>While the announcement of CEO Beena Goldenberg's retirement was made in late May 2025, it remains a key piece of information for investors. Goldenberg will continue in her role until the end of the company's fiscal year on September 30, 2025, to ensure a smooth transition. The board has initiated a search for her successor.</p>
<p><strong>Options Market News</strong></p>
<p>No specific news articles detailing the impact of these recent developments on Organigram Holdings Inc.'s options trading were found within the last 30 days. Financial news outlets that cover options data, such as Perplexity Finance and Public.com, indicate the availability of options trading data for Organigram, but have not published any specific analysis or news on recent options activity. It is common for significant company news, such as a major market expansion, to influence options trading, including implied volatility and trading volume. Financial analysts would typically monitor options data providers for any unusual activity following such announcements.</p>

                            <h3>UGE International Embarks on New Chapter with Going-Private Transaction Finalized</h3>
<p><strong>Toronto, ON</strong> - UGE International Ltd. has officially completed its transition to a private entity following the closing of a plan of arrangement. This move, effective August 15, 2024, saw an affiliate of NOVA Infrastructure Fund II, LP acquire all outstanding common shares of UGE for C$2.00 per share.</p>
<p>The acquisition, first announced in May, received overwhelming approval from securityholders on July 31, 2024. A brief delay in the closing, initially scheduled for around August 8, was announced on August 9 to allow certain rolling shareholders to complete necessary share transfers for their continued participation in the private company.</p>
<p>As a result of the completed transaction, UGE's common shares will be delisted from the TSX Venture Exchange and OTC Markets. The company also intends to apply to cease being a reporting issuer, thereby terminating its public reporting obligations.</p>
<p>In other recent developments, UGE announced on July 16, 2024, that its 510kW rooftop community solar project on Staten Island, New York, has achieved commercial operation. The project, located atop a shopping center, has now begun generating electricity.</p>
<p>Earlier in the month, on July 11, 2024, the company reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Key highlights included a 64% increase in energy generation revenue compared to the same period in the previous year, reaching $175.9K from its 5.6MW of operating assets.</p>

                            <h3>Curo Group Emerges from Bankruptcy as a Private Entity</h3>
<p><strong>July 19, 2024</strong> - Curo Group Holdings Corp. has successfully emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, rebranding as Curo Group Holdings LLC. This marks a new phase for the company, which is now a private entity and its stock will no longer be traded on public exchanges.</p>
<p>The restructuring plan, which received overwhelming support from stakeholders, has significantly strengthened Curo's financial position. The company has reduced its debt by approximately $1 billion and will save at least $75 million in annual interest payments, leading to improved liquidity.</p>
<p>Under the plan, which was confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas on May 16, 2024, and also recognized by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, all allowed claims from general unsecured creditors, including employees, landlords, and customers, will be paid in full.</p>
<p>Doug Clark, the Chief Executive Officer of Curo, stated that the company is now "a substantially stronger business and... better positioned to achieve long-term profitable growth." The company will continue to offer a variety of financial services to its customers.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, on March 11, 2024, the New York Stock Exchange had initiated proceedings to delist Curo's common stock due to the company's failure to meet the minimum required average global market capitalization. Subsequently, on March 25, 2024, Curo announced its plan to enter a Restructuring Support Agreement and commence a voluntary Chapter 11 reorganization to implement a prepackaged restructuring plan.</p>

                            <h3>Southeastern Grocers Restructures Following Ownership Change, Resulting in Layoffs</h3>
<p><strong>Jacksonville, Fla.</strong> - Southeastern Grocers, the parent company of Winn-Dixie and Harveys Supermarkets, has undergone a restructuring that includes layoffs at its Jacksonville headquarters and in field support teams across the Southeast. The company, which was recently acquired by a consortium of private investors led by its CEO Anthony Hucker and C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers, stated the move was a "difficult but necessary decision" to align its structure with the future direction of the business.</p>
<p>The restructuring follows the sale of approximately 400 Winn-Dixie and Harveys stores to Aldi U.S. in March 2024, and the subsequent buy-back of around 170 of those locations by the new ownership group in February 2025. Southeastern Grocers will continue to operate a smaller number of stores as some locations are converted to the Aldi format through 2027. The company has not disclosed the exact number of employees affected by the layoffs, citing its status as a private company.</p>
<p>In a statement, the company emphasized its commitment to the long-term health of the business and its focus on serving its customers and supporting its stores. Impacted employees are being offered a support package that includes compensation, continued health benefits, and career coaching resources.</p>
<p>Separately, Southeastern Grocers released its 2024 Impact Report on Earth Day, highlighting its commitment to sustainability and social responsibility. The report noted a 9.34% increase in diverse suppliers in 2024 and the introduction of dedicated endcaps in 65 stores to feature products from emerging diverse brands. The company also received 107 industry awards for its private-label products in the past year.</p>

                            <h3>Bluerock Proposes Major Liquidity Event for Flagship Real Estate Fund</h3>
<p><strong>New York, NY – July 3, 2025</strong> – Bluerock has announced a significant proposal for its flagship real estate fund, the Bluerock Total Income+ Real Estate Fund (TI+). The company's board has unanimously recommended converting the fund from a closed-end interval fund to a listed closed-end fund that would trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>This move is designed to provide shareholders with enhanced liquidity and the potential for stronger long-term returns. Ramin Kamfar, Founder and CEO of Bluerock, stated that the proposal is the result of direct engagement with investors and reflects the company's commitment to acting in their best interests.</p>
<p>The conversion to a listed structure is expected to allow for full daily liquidity and more agile capital deployment, positioning the fund to capitalize on current opportunities in the private real estate market. Ryan MacDonald, Bluerock's Chief Investment Officer, noted that this could lead to enhanced total returns and more frequent, monthly distributions to shareholders.</p>
<p>A special meeting for shareholder approval is tentatively scheduled for September 3, 2025. If approved, TI+ would become the largest real estate-focused listed closed-end fund globally.</p>
<p>However, some industry observers have noted that similar moves by other illiquid real estate funds have faced challenges in the public markets. The Bluerock Total Income+ Real Estate Fund has experienced an increase in repurchase requests since early 2023, a trend seen across other real estate-focused interval funds and non-traded REITs as interest rates have risen. The fund's net asset value per share has declined from its peak in the summer of 2022.</p>
<h3>Bluerock High Income Institutional Credit Fund Reaches 3-Year Milestone with Strong Performance</h3>
<p><strong>New York, NY – June 24 &amp; July 8, 2025</strong> – The Bluerock High Income Institutional Credit Fund (HI) has celebrated its three-year operational anniversary, a key benchmark for mutual funds. The fund has established itself with attractive yields and positive total returns each year.</p>
<p>The fund's primary objective is to generate high current income with low correlation to the broader markets by investing in private credit through Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs).</p>
<p>Key highlights from recent announcements include:
*   An 11.3% annualized distribution rate over the trailing 12 months as of July 8, 2025.
*   The fund announced its twelfth consecutive quarterly distribution, expecting to pay approximately $0.55 per share for the quarter.
*   As of June 30, 2025, the fund's net assets under management were approximately $190 million.
*   The fund's investment adviser has agreed to limit net annual fund operating expenses until at least January 31, 2026.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Schwaber, CEO of Bluerock Capital Markets, commented that the fund's focus on strong credit opportunities has allowed it to consistently generate double-digit yields.</p>
<h3>Bluerock Total Income+ Real Estate Fund Announces 50th Consecutive Quarterly Distribution</h3>
<p><strong>New York, NY – June 18, 2025</strong> – The Bluerock Total Income+ Real Estate Fund paid its 50th consecutive quarterly distribution in the second quarter of 2025. The distribution was $0.3369 per share, representing 1.3125% for the quarter. This continues the fund's long history of providing regular distributions to its investors.</p>
